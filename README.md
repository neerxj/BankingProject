# BankingProject
My First Year C++ Project.

PROJECT DEFINITION:
The project that I chose to implement is the Banking Management System. The Banking Management System is a C++ program which will be used for maintaining accounts for a Bank. The program will allow for the creation of new accounts, and the management of existing accounts. The program will allow users to input their Credit/Debit Card identification, and pin to gain access into their account. The details will then be validated with the stored information to see if the correct details were entered. Once gaining access into the account, the user is able to complete the various functionalities available within the Banking Management System. The Banking Application and the contents of the file must be secure, and throughout the program there will be error handling and input handling to prevent incorrect entry.
